# RL CRICKET SIMULATION ENGINE
## Description

A 2D Cricket game simulation engine in which an RL based bowler(agent) is trained to bowl as per different batting styles and fielder distributions on the field. The bowler is trained with an objective to give away as minimal run as possible to the batsman and at the same time take the maximum number of wickets down.
To be done:
1) Train an agent(Batsman) skilled enough to play any ball.
2) Translate the 2D simulation to a 3D environment.
